        <b>History of Technology</b>
        <p> The development over time of systematic techniques for making and doing things. The term technology, a
            combination of the Greek technē, "art, craft," with logos, "word, speech," meant in Greece a discourse on
            the arts, both fine and applied. When it first appeared in English in the 17th century, it was used to mean
            a discussion of the applied arts only, and gradually these "arts" themselves came to be the object of the
            designation. By the early 20th century the term embraced a growing range of means, processes, and ideas in
            addition to tools and machines. By mid-century technology was defined by such phrases as "the means or
            activity by which man seeks to change or manipulate his environment." Even such broad definitions have been
            criticized by observers who point out the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between scientific inquiry
            and technological activity.</p>
